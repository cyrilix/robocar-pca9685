# d2xx

Package d2xx is a thin Go wrapper for the Future Technology "D2XX" driver at
https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d2xx-drivers/.

See https://periph.io/device/ftdi/ for more details, and how to configure
the host to be able to use this driver.

This package is not Go idiomatic. You will want to use
https://periph.io/x/host/v3/ftdi (or later) instead.

But if you really want, here it goes:
[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/periph.io/x/d2xx)](https://pkg.go.dev/periph.io/x/d2xx)

This Go package includes third party software. See
[third_party/README.md](third_party/README.md).
